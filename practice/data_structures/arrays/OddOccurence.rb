# Given an array where all elements appear even number of times except one. 
# All repeating occurrences of elements appear in pairs and these pairs are not adjacent (there cannot be more than two consecutive occurrences of any element). 
# Find the element that appears odd number of times.
# Note that input like {2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1} is valid as all repeating occurrences occur in pairs and these pairs are not adjacent.
# Input like {2, 1, 2} is invalid as repeating elements donâ€™t appear in pairs. Also, input like {1, 2, 2, 2, 2} is invalid as two pairs of 2 are adjacent. 
# Input like {2, 2, 2, 1} is also invalid as there are three consecutive occurrences of 2.
