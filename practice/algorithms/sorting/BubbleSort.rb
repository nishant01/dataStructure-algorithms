#Bubble Sort Implementation (works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.)
#Time-complexity : O(n^2), In-place,Can be made stable
# Takes O(n^2) even when array already sorted (hence can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if inner loop didnâ€™t cause any swap.)



def bubble_sort(a)
   n=a.length
   for i in 0...n-1
    for j in 0...n-i-1

            a[j]=a[j+1]
