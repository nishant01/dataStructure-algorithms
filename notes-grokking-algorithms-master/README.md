# Grokking Algorithms

This repository includes a brief summary of [Grooking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230), which I believe is a great book for anyone interested in Computer Science.

> According to 'Programming Pearls', only 10% of professional programmers are able to implement binary search in their code. They can explain it very well, but coding it is a challenge for them.

Each folder follows the chapter structure of the book, and includes:

1. Summary as markdown
1. Summary as PDF
1. Code examples in Python
1. Code examples in Ruby
1. Images and charts related with the chapter.
