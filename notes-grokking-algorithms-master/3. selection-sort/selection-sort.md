## Selection Sort

![selection-sort](images/selection-sort.png)

- Selection sort takes O(n<sup>2</sup>) time.
- It actually takes n*(n+1)/2 time (n<sup>2</sup>+n / 2), however since we don't care about constants, it is **n<sup>2</sup>**

- Selection sort is a neat algorithm, but it’s not very fast. Quicksort is a faster sorting algorithm that only takes **O(n logn)** time. It’s coming up in the next chapter!
